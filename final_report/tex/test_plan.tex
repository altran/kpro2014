\subsection{Test Plan}
\subsubsection{Unit Testing}
We are planning to use JUnit to do the unit testing. Every single test is done by the developer, which means that the tests for a module are written by the developer who made the module. 

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Unit Test Plan}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|X|X|}
	\hline
	Modules
	&Description
	&Input
	&Output
	\\ \hline Visualiser
	&The visualiser will be able to showcase the data which is pulled from the database.
	&When the program starts, it will obtain data from the database.
	&Visualisation is displayed in the correct fashion with the correct data.
	\\ \hline Central hub
	&The central hub collects data from the sensors using a DASH7 protocol and uses REST API to store it in the database.
	&Data from sensors.
	&Data into the database
	\\ \hline Database
	&The database contains all the information gathered from the central hub.
	&Data from the central hub.
	&Data can be pulled by the visualiser from the database.
	\\ \hline Sensor
	&The sensors create and send data based on the environment they are in.
	&Environment observation.
	&Data about their environment.
	\\ \hline 
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Integration Testing}
In this section we will collect the different modules of our prototype together and test if they are able to correctly work.

\paragraph{Modules that need to be integrated} \ \\
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Visualiser from database
	\item
	Central hub to database
	\item
	Central hub from sensors
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Test that need to be done to each integration} \ \\
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Visualiser from database:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		Visualiser needs the right call to get information from database.
		\item
		Visualiser can get the data from the database.
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	Central hub to database
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		Central hub will connect to database
		\item
		Central hub will post the new information into the database
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	Sensor to central hub
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		Central hub will pull the data from sensors
		\item
		Central hub will listen to the sensors
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

	\\ \hline Central hub data storage
	&T2
	&1.1, 2.2
	&After processing the data, it will be pushed forward into the database and stored. This process will be using REST API.

	\\ \hline Visualiser displaying the data
	&T5
	&4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3
	&Visualiser displaying the correct data that it pulled from the database. The data should be displayed correctly both for the table, and for the animation.
	\\ \hline Visualiser switches what data to visualise
	&T6
	&4.3
	&The user should be able to manipulate what data to visualise at any time by using checkboxes.

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
	\hline
	Test Name
	&Test Scenario 3
	\\ \hline Description
	&First the sensors, central hub and the database need to be set up. We will see if the sensors gather the correct data, and if they do, how the central hub pulls the data from the sensors, processes the data and then stores it.
	\\ \hline Enviroment
	&Run time
	\\ \hline Test case involved
	&T0, T1, T2
	\\ \hline Dependency
	&None
	\\ \hline Input
	&The data of surrounding environment.
	\\ \hline Output
	&The correct data is stored into the database
	\\ \hline Acceptance
	&If the data stored is correct and in the format we wanted.

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
	\hline
	Test Name
	&Test Scenario 2
	\\ \hline Description
	&A new sensor is added during runtime and we see if the data can be registered by the central hub. After that remove the sensor and see if this affects rest of the system. 
	\\ \hline Enviroment
	&Run time
	\\ \hline Test case involved
	&T3
	\\ \hline Dependency
	&Test scenario 1
	\\ \hline Input
	&A new set of sensor data / removing a sensor
	\\ \hline Output
	&If a new set of sensor data is added, it will be shown independently on the next pull from the central hub. If the sensor is removed the data in the database will reflect that by not updating anything.
	\\ \hline Acceptance
	&When the new sensor set is updated correctly with correct data. And if we remove any sensors, the database will not update anything random and the whole system should not crash.

\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
	\hline
	Test Name
	&Test Scenario 3
	\\ \hline Description
	&This test will cover all functions for the visualiser. The visualiser will pull data from the database and then show them on the GUI. This will be done both in the traditional table format and an animation format. The user should also be able to chose what to show by interacting with the program.
	\\ \hline Enviroment
	&Run time
	\\ \hline Test case involved
	&T4, T5, T6
	\\ \hline Dependency
	&Test scenario 2
	\\ \hline Input
	&The data of the surrounding environment.
	\\ \hline Output
	&The correct data is shown on the visualiser. And the user interaction works (meaning one can turn off what data one does not want to see).
	\\ \hline Acceptance
	&The data is correctly shown both on the table and in the animation. The animation needs to be smooth (meaning at least 24 fps). The user interaction will not have any impact other than hiding or showing a certain data type.

	\\ \hline Description
	&This test will be an overall test that will last over a long period of time. We will set up the system in a closed environment and observe the changes of data over a long period of time (twelve or more hours, depending on the battery life). During this time the data will be stored and shown.

	&The data of the surrounding environment.
	\\ \hline Output
	&The correct data is shown on the visualiser.
	\\ \hline Acceptance
	&Same as in test scenario 3, just that the system has to be able to run over the whole period of time without any failure that shuts down the system, in other words failure handling is a concern in this case.
