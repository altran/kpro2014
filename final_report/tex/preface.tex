\section*{Preface}
This report is the main delivery in the course TDT4290 Customer Driven Project at the Norwegian University of Technology and Science, in the fall of 2014. The project was carried out on behalf of Altran Norge AS between August 26 and November 20. 

The task in this project was to visualise the data gathered by a number of sensors in an interesting fashion. This report describes the process of the project in three sections; starting from the initial planning phase and requirements, through the sprints and the implementation phase, and finishing with the project evaluation and summary. The appendices supplement the report by giving additional information about tools, templates, an installation guide, and changes done throughout the project.

The team would like to thank our supervisor Mohsen Anvaari for his continuous advice and input throughout the project. We would also like to thank our customer contact from Altran Norge, Stig Lau, for all help and feedback he has given us during the project.
