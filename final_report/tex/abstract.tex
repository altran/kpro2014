The Internet of Things (IoT) is a term describing the widespread use of internet-connected devices in our everyday environment. The number of such devices is generally predicted to increase six-fold by 2020, and many novel uses have already been demonstrated. IoT also generates a considerable revenue for many companies, and acquires momentum as more companies invest money. For this reason, IoT applications is a promising field of investigation. The goal of this project is to create ideas and inspire new applications by creating an IoT showroom. A system of interconnected wireless sensors will monitor changes in the room, and the sensor data will be put together into an interactive, audio-visual presentation. The system is configurable and can be installed in different places. It is also robust, supporting the relocation of sensors, and can handle sensor loss and instability. The project, includes three different showroom prototypes. \gls{Java} was used for implementation, with \gls{JavaFX} being used for the graphical front-end. A thorough investigation was made into solutions for NoSQL data storage, and an outline is provided of sensor capabilities and challenges with hardware.
