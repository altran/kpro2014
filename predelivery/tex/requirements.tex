It lists the quality attributes, our choice of architectural style, constraints, tactics, stakeholders, architectural views and the reasoning for choosing this architecture.

The requirements document is the second part of the requirements section and it describes all of the requirements of our project. It also contains the main conceptual views of our implementation.

The last part of the requirements document is the test plan, outlining tests that are to be performed to insure that all the requirements are fulfilled.
